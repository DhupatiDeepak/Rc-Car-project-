# Rc-Car-project-
This project entails constructing a Bluetooth-controlled RC car using an Arduino Uno R3 and a motor driver. It utilizes a Bluetooth module for wireless communication with external devices like smartphones or computers. Commands sent over Bluetooth dictate the car's movements, including forward, backward, left turn, right turn, and stop.
